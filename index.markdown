Introduction
============

Welcome to the companion site for the paper "FiloBass: A Dataset and Corpus Based Study of Jazz Basslines" presented at ISMIR 2023. This was work carried out by Xavier Riley, a PhD candidate on the [AIM programme](https://aim.qmul.ac.uk/) at QMUL.

Each piece is ~6mins, so the dataset totals roughly ~5hours of audio.

This site contains links to Soundslice pages where you can preview all the data. Here's an example:
